    - GH #15: fix debugger test (thanks, djerius)

3.0.0 Sat 5 May 2018

    - breaking change:
        - the behaviour of UNIVERSAL methods like $native->can and
          $native->isa is now defined as being the same as when autobox
          is not enabled rather than "undefined". (technically, this
          still falls under the rubric of "undefined", but the switch
          from "don't know" to "don't" could break buggy code, so bump
          for safety)
        - add DOES to the list of non-autoboxed methods
    - switch to SemVer i.e. 2.86 (v2.860.0) -> 3.0.0 (v3.0.0)
    - upgrade ppport.h from 3.35 -> 3.42

2.86 Fri 20 Apr 2018

    - GH #9: fix bug which prevented autoboxing working
      under the debugger on perl 5.22+ (thanks, skington)
        - added t/debugger.t
    - GH #8: fix bug which prevented bareword method-calls being
      exempted when the method is a variable e.g. Foo->$bar
    - add operator-overloading note to the gotchas section (GH #7)
